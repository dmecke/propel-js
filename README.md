# propel-js - Tiny Open Phsics Library.
A free, open source, teeny weeny physics library for typescript. Mostly just some utilities for making games.

[Documentation](https://kevglass.github.io/propel-js/)

## Why?

When working with networked physics games it's useful to be able to seralize state to send across the wire. Other physics
engines do this by providing a seralizer but doing this regularly can be expensive. propel-js aims to keep physics state
in serializable structures with functions/resolvers outside of the data.

## Features

* Rectangles
* Circles
* Joints

More added as time permits.
